"""``build_robot_policy`` resolves preset defaults and honours overrides.

The preset table is the single definition of a robot's wire contract, so what
matters is that the *right* values reach the policy loader -- not that the engine
runs. The loader is stubbed out, which keeps this test CPU-only and instant.
