"""Register a robot preset from your own package -- no GPU, no weights.

A preset is an ``Embodiment x Convention`` pairing:

* a :class:`~apxinf_robo.conventions.base.Convention` is a fact about a *client*
  -- what a simulator, a dataset recorder, or a robot stack calls its cameras,
  its state, and its prompt. It survives a change of robot;
* an :class:`~apxinf_robo.embodiments.base.Embodiment` is a fact about a *body*
  -- how many cameras it carries, how wide its state and action vectors are, and
  (optionally) the pre/post steps that turn its numbers into the model's;
* a :class:`~apxinf_robo.embodiments.base.RobotPreset` pairs them, cross-checked.

Both registries are open. A deployment that speaks its own dialect registers it
from its own module scope and never edits this package -- which is the whole
reason ``register_convention`` / ``register_robot_preset`` are public. Doing it
at import time is what makes ``--robot mine`` work in a process that imported
your module.

See doc/adding-an-embodiment.md for the full story, including how to attach a
body's arithmetic with a custom builder.
