"""Dataset recording conventions used on the inference wire.

A :class:`Convention` defines camera keys in model view-slot order, the state
key, the prompt key, and whether state is encoded into the prompt.

**Why this lives in apxinf-robo and not in the engine.** A convention is a fact
about a *client* — what a simulator, a dataset recorder, or a robot stack calls
its cameras. The engine has one fixed input contract
(:data:`~apxinf.policies.base.CANONICAL_IMAGE_KEYS` / ``state`` / ``prompt``) and
does not adapt to dialects; adapting is this repository's job. That keeps the
engine's input contract single-owner and lets it grow toward VLM/LLM without
carrying an ``image_keys`` field forever.

What a convention may depend on:

* :data:`~apxinf.policies.base.VIEW_SLOTS` — model vocabulary, needed to say
  which slot each camera key fills. That is a one-way read of a naming table; no
  policy class is imported and no model is loaded.

This module does not depend on robot bodies or policy implementations.

A convention alone is not deployable — pairing it with an
:class:`~apxinf_robo.embodiments.base.Embodiment` is, and
:class:`~apxinf_robo.embodiments.base.RobotPreset` is where the two are
validated against each other.
