"""apxinf-robo: the robot-facing layer over the ApxInf inference engine.

ApxInf is an inference engine. It knows checkpoints, tensors, and the numeric
chain between them. It deliberately does not know that a Unitree G1 has sixteen
degrees of freedom, that LIBERO calls its wrist camera
``observation/wrist_image``, or that robosuite's ``OSC_POSE`` controller wants
axis-angle. Those facts change when you swap the *body* or the *environment*,
not when you swap the checkpoint, and they belong to whoever owns the robot.

That is this package. It supplies four separable things:

:mod:`~apxinf_robo.conventions`
    Wire-key dialects -- what a client calls its cameras, state, and prompt.

:mod:`~apxinf_robo.embodiments`
    Bodies -- DoF layout, gripper conventions, delta masks, and the pre/post
    steps that turn a body's numbers into the model's and back.

:mod:`~apxinf_robo.presets`
    Named ``Embodiment x Convention`` pairings, and :func:`build_robot_policy`
    to load one.

:mod:`~apxinf_robo.envs`
    Evaluation-environment glue (LIBERO, robosuite, IsaacLab).

Everything reaches the engine through :mod:`apxinf_robo.engine`, the one module
that imports ``apxinf``.

    >>> from apxinf_robo import build_robot_policy, check_checkpoint, format_findings

    >>> policy = build_robot_policy("unitree_g1", "/ckpt/pi05_g1")              # doctest: +SKIP
